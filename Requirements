For our SRS, we will enter our requirements here.
Requirement: condition/capability that must be met by our game. Specify WHAT not HOW. specify
 enough to allow designers to choose how to implement.

Our iterations will assume requirements from the SRS. These should be unambiguous, 
well understood, testable and verifiable.

Start w/ needs of 'client and user' i.e. what interface is needed? what line of communication
will be available to talk to the user?
